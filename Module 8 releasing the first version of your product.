Module 8 releasing the first version of your product.
We discuss what the early reaction without spending any money in advertising.
PMF(product market fit)=is there is fit between your product and market out there.
How do you think about pivoting? Pivot about something you made to try new one.
First version of product not led by marketing, not led by paid advertising not led by money else led by something else what are those things?
there is pattern essentially 7 mechanism in which product is distributed to its first set of costumers when it is launched.
1> offline: you reach your customer to actual offline world.
2> online: in forum of similar website. Reach your customer online.
3> invite: you get 1st set of customer coming in and allow them to invite other people. Fb. Invitation is powerful, it don’t matter who we send to  its matter who they send .
4> FOMO: make exclusive and can’t get through then people speak about it. Eg CRED or app with waiting list.
5> influencers: TikTok. Local small influencer and happy to share free.
6> press: media if you are unique.
7> build community: in fb page etc

Which of this works better for what context:
Let’s go to TMT framework for that.

If you are tech company in B2C and you don’t have retention but you have massive acquisition and people coming through then ok we can start.

You go to market but people don’t give good response and you trying to explain your product but it don’t look promising then you struggling them to stay and someone suggest you should consider pivoting. 

Pivot:
You can’t pivot from being car manufacturer to being airplane manufacturer. You use pivot at one point and rotates but cannot change position of that point. 
Pivoting means if something don’t work or works and you want to extend it, then you do something common to what you were doing and you want to do and it extends on the skills that you create. 
Fig in copy:
They will drug themselves into believing that they are growing and they have one thing that’s hope but there are enough signs of along the way to tell them this is’ t working out so they should clear mirror and go towards pivoting.
If revenue and growth going down then you do pivoting. What skill you pivot to?
If I have to shut everything down I have built and I can take one thing along with me that must likely what you pivot to.
That is what you have built  which you feel have some value over and above the entire orchestra that you have built to make this business work. This is what you should be pivoting. This is what will get you hopefully to next thing that makes sense or not. If tomato walk with one thing it will be relationship that had with restaurant Ie entire database that had because that what is valuable no-one else had that. That’s when they used to pivot. Question they asked is what else can I do with this db of every restaurant. That they use for food delivery which is obvious answer.
swiggy food delivery don’t work out take is how to run super efficient delivery network for pivoting. And that why they are now grocery delivery and everything around supply chain and logistics. Tomato also tried that but failed because it has not build good scale in that.
